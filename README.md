[Documentation](https://aeria.land/docs/aeria/)

Aeria is a <10k lines of code **web framework** with a strong emphasis in type safety and developer experience. It ships a thin **MongoDB** abstraction layer and a Prisma-like DSL that serves model definition with support for nested objects, arrays, references, upload fields, and more. On top of that a HTTP routing API with very simple bindings is provided to build business logic.

The project was created to offer a more cohesive and type-safe alternative to projects with CRUD-heavy needs. It is also a modern alternative to Mongoose and Prisma.
